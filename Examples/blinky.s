@ To debug this program, you need to change your "Run and Debug"
@   configuration from "Emulate current ARM .s file" to "Graphic Emulate
@   current ARM .s file".
@
@ You can do this is either of the followig two ways:
@
@   1. Switch to the Run and Debug panel ("ladybug/play" icon on the left).
@      Change the dropdown at the top of the Run and Debug panel to "Graphic
@      Emulate current ARM .s file".
@
@   2. ctrl-shift-P (cmd-shift-P on a Mac) and type "Select and Start Debugging".
@      When prompted, select "Graphic Emulate ...".
